# Example: Using Terraform network mirror for providers

This repo will show you how to have a static web server hosting your terraform providers so you can download them from this webserver instead of from the internet itself

For more details about Terraform Network Mirror [see the official HashiCorp documentation](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#cli-configuration-file-terraformrc-or-terraform-rc). 

This repo uses Vagrant to create 2 virtual machines.

Vagrant virtual machine: **nginx**
- ubuntu virtual machine starts
- Nginx webserver will be installed, configured and started
- TLS certificates will be generated and stored under ```/vagrant/ssl```
- Terraform will be installed
- Terraform will download the AWS provider from the internet and store it under ```/vagrant/terraform_file_mirror```

Vagrant virtual machine: **tf**
- ubuntu virtual machine starts
- TLS certificates will be installed generated by nginx machine from the location ```/vagrant/ssl```
- Terraform will be installed
- A terraform CLI configuration file will be placed on the server which will use the Nginx Webserver to download terraform provider from

After this you will manually login to the Vagrant virtual machine **tf** and initialize terraform.  
You will see the download of the provider happening from the nginx virtual machine instead of the public internet

# Prerequisites

## Vagrant
Vagrant [See documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation)  
Virtualbox [See documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)


# How to

- Clone the repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/munnep/provider_network_mirror.git
```
- Go to the directory
```
cd provider_network_mirror
```
- start the Vagrant virtual machines
```
vagrant up
```
- login to the virtual machine **tf**
```
vagrant ssh tf
```
- optional   
Set terraform LOG to DEBUG mode. You can then see clearly with the terraform initialization where the downloaded provider is coming from
```
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
```
- go to the ```/vagrant``` directory where the provider file is found
```
cd /vagrant
```
- Terraform initialize
```
terraform init
```
- sample output with DEBUG level. See the GET with your FQDN
```
